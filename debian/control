Description: user-friendly telnet client mainly targets BBS users
 PCManX is a newly developed GPL'd version of PCMan, a full-featured
 famous BBS client. It aimed to be an easy-to-use yet full-featured telnet
 client facilitating BBS browsing with the ability to process double-byte
 characters. Some handy functions like tabbed-browsing, auto-login and
 a built-in ANSI editor enabling colored text editing are also provided.
 .
 This version is developed with pure gtk2 and xft, thus has much low
 dependency.
